    "purpose": "Provide a single source of truth for UI selectors to prevent test flakiness caused by volatile Tailwind classes or DOM changes.",
    "strategy": "Use stable attributes (data-cy, id, name) where possible. Map UI components to logical keys.",
    "usage": "In tests, use cy.getSelector('key.path'). For actions, pass the key path directly to action functions.",
    "maintenance": "When the UI changes, update the selector here. Tests remain untouched as they consume the logical keys."
